# KYFGLib_Image_Stitching

This C++ project demonstrates how to use the Vision Point API for image stitching from multiple cameras.

## Description

'KYFG_BufferAnnounceChunks' API function is used for the construction of a composite image from chunks assigned to multiple cameras. 
The cameras are configured to run in freerun mode with the same frame rate.

## Requirements

- OpenCV SDK should be configured in the system
- Vision Point API (KYFGLib) library installed.
- KAYA Instruments PCIe device.
